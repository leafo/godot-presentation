# Hi

My name is Leaf Corcoran.

Places where you might see me:

Hello world these are notes

class: center, middle

## I'm the founder of itch.io

---

class: center, middle

## Some backstory?

---

class: center, middle

<img src="oldphoto.jpg" style="width: 50%" alt="" />

???

Maybe a similar story to many of you, when I was younger I loved to play some
games. And then I thought I should try to make games.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="book.jpg" style="width: 40%" alt="" />

???

I soon realized it is very difficult to make games, after trying to get through
through a C++ book my dad bought for me.

---

class: center, middle

<img src="rpgmaker.jpg" style="width: 60%" alt="" />

???

I abandoned that, relegating myself to RPG Maker for a bit, but ending up on
learning on how to build websites. Of course at this point on 14 years old, but
it sets the stage.

I'm a Godot beginner. I'm looking forward to using it on my next Ludum Dare
project.

But ask me about distribution.

???

Feel free to ask me questions about deploying and publishing your
game, but I still might get a little mixed up about the Project Settings dialog.

# Distributing your game

???

Generally we build games so we can have other people play them. itch.io is a
platform for independent developers to distribute their work so I think we have
a good match.

---

class: center, middle

# TL;DR: it's easy

???

So if you've used itch.io, you're probably family with many of these things.
But sometimes hearings things you already know gives you new ideas for things
to try in the future.

## A self-service dashboard

<img src="dashboard.png" width="100%" />

???

Everything is self service. Dashboard offers rich set of features an analytics
to customize your launch. This is where you host sales, bundles, upload
screenshots, your builds, trailers, & tell us what your game is, etc.

## Deploying your game

---

class: center, middle

## Two kinds of project types

---

class: middle

## Two kinds of project types (relevant to Godot)

* Downloadable
  * Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android, etc.
* HTML5

???

These can be combined, so you can embed a demo in your project page and provide
downloads for a full, higher performance, experience.

These correspond to the HTML, individual operating system export templates.

# Briefly about mobile

class: middle

# Briefly about mobile

* Upload APK files directly
  * Not the greatest UX, but it's there
* Mobile HTML games

---

class: center, middle

# HTML 5 Games

???

You're going to hear the word easy a lot!

HTML5 is easy. It's a good candidate for games that don't have
high performance requirements. Games can be loaded directly into modern browser
(Firefox, Chrome).

---

# HTML5 Games

* Upload a `zip` file containing all your games resources.
* We extract it, and put the `index.html` file in an `iframe`

---

class: center

## Exporting with default settings works great

<video width="80%" loop onclick='this.play()'>
  <source src="godot_html_export.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

---

# HTML5 Games

* Upload a `zip` file containing all your games resources.
* We extract it, and put the `index.html` file in an `iframe`
* Recommended: Export your game to new directory, name it `index`
* Export it → Zip it → Upload it
  * Doesn't matter if `index.html` is nested

---

# HTML5 Games: Viewport

<img src="viewport.gif" alt="" />

---

# HTML5 Games: Viewport

Test width & height is what your game's dimensions will be. Plug that into itch.io

<img src="display-settings.png" alt="" />

---

# HTML5 Games: Viewport

* Test width & height is initial game dimensions
* Recommended: Make your window resizable
* Use `OS.set_window_maximized` to make your game take up the available area


---

# Maximize your game

Use this script to maximize the game to the `iframe` after it loads.

```gdscript
func _ready():
	if OS.get_name() == "HTML5":
		OS.set_window_maximized(true)

```

Plays well with itch.io's built in fullscreen button.

# Downloadable Games

# Downloadable Games

* Godot makes cross platform builds, take advantage of it
  * We have strong Windows, Linux, and MacOS communities

Linux is beating out MacOS here, which is cool

---

# Downloadable Games

* Godot makes cross platform builds, take advantage of it
  * We have strong Windows, Linux, and MacOS communities
* Our app will figure out how to run your games
  * Godot games are standalone so it works by default

---

# Downloadable Games: App manifest

Create `.itch.toml` at top level of game directory

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "play"
path = "FooBar.exe"

[[actions]]
name = "editor"
path = "FooBar.exe"
args = ["--editor"]
```

# Downloadable Games

* Godot makes cross platform builds, take advantage of it
  * We have strong Windows, Linux, and MacOS communities
* Our app will figure out how to run your games
  * Godot games are standalone so it works by default
* You can customize launching with `.itch.toml`
* Your manifest can specify prerequisites for Windows
  * Visual C++ Runtime, .NET Framework
* You can opt into the itch.io sandbox


---

# Downloadable Games: API access

* Use the API to see who is playing your game
  * You can check that they own it, if you want DRM
* API is HTTP based, in Godot you will use `HTTPClient` or `HTTPRequest`
* Simple now, but will be more complex in the near future
* Note: API keys timeout, make sure to renew them

---

# Downloadable Games: API access

App will automatically give you an API key connecting your game, and the
developer's account. Request it with `scope`:

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "play"
path = "FooBar.exe"
scope = "profile:me"
```

Learn more: <https://itch.io/docs/itch/integrating/api/>

---
 
# Downloadable Games: API access

API key is handed to game via environment variable

* `ITCHIO_API_KEY`: the API key
* `ITCHIO_API_KEY_EXPIRES_AT`: Expiration date

---

```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready():
  var api_key = OS.get_environment("ITCHIO_API_KEY")
  var http = HTTPClient.new()

  # Use HTTPS and verify host!
  http.connect_to_host("itch.io", -1, true, true)
  
  while http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_CONNECTING or http.get_status() == HTTPClient.STATUS_RESOLVING:
    http.poll()
    OS.delay_msec(500)
    
  err = http.request(HTTPClient.METHOD_GET, "/api/1/jwt/me", [
    "Host: itch.io",
    "Authorization: " + api_key
  ])

  ## read the body...
```
---

# Downloadable Games: API access

* `HTTPRequest` node should work too
* TODO: We will write a library for you to use :)
* HTML5 games launched through the app have slightly different interface
  * See the docs: <https://itch.io/docs/itch/integrating/manifest.html>

# Incremental Updates With Patching

---

# Butler is our command line tool

* Open source: <https://github.com/itchio/butler>
* Point it at your extracted game directory, it figures out what you changed
* Updates are efficient: <https://amos.me/blog/2017/efficient-game-updates/>
  * Combination of rsync and bsdiff algorithms

---

# Butler: Good for developers and players

* Uploads are resilient to bad internet, resumable
* Only a patch needs to be uploaded
* Only a patch needs to be downloaded
* App users get resumable downloads

### One command to deploy

```bash
butler push directory user/game:channel
```
---

class: center, middle

<img src="patch-upload.gif" width="90%" alt="" />

A simple code change yields a small patch:

```bash
18 KiB patch (99.93% savings)
```
